## Course Overview

Previously, in this course you would be doing simple lab experiments related to the material in Physics 71 (Quantum and Thermal Physics) and writing up lab reports.

However, because of the pandemic and the uncertainty meeting in person we decided to try something new.  We are taking this opportunity to modernize the course and to make it more like what you would be doing if you did summer research with one of the research groups on campus or at SLAC.

We are going to focus on data analysis and interpretation, and on getting you comfortable using modern software to do the data analysis.  The goal is to teach you what you would learn in the first few weeks of doing a summer research program, while also covering topics related to the material in Physics 71.

We will be using public data relating to a number of topics in modern physics to explore these data analysis techniques.  No prior knowledge about the scientific topics is required, and we will be provided references to help you explore any questions that you might have about the scientific context.


### Lab Sessions

This class will meet for 10 weeks.  Each week we will meet for an 80 minute lab-like class session.  You will spend most of the time in those session working through some data analysis exercises in the form of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.  The notebooks include a number of questions.  Your assignment will be to answer those questions in a short "lab report".  You will have the choice to either finish the lab reports after class, or to hand them in at any time in the week after the class. 

The class breakdown will look something like this:

- First 10-20 minutes (longer the first week): presentation by the instructors.
  - Some comments about the context of the weeks exercises from the instructors.  This will include:
	- Data analysis context: what techniques we wil be learning that week.
	- Scientific context: some information about the datasets we will be using.
- Remainder of class session: working in small (2-3 person) groups.
  - Working though the notebooks
  - Discussing your findings with your group
  - Option to ask questions, take a break and chat with other students or the instructors.


### Final project / presentation

The last two weeks of the class will be devoted to working on presenting a short (2 or 3 slide) presentation following up on some data analysis
from one of the topics that we covered in the course.

Week 9 will be a chance to work on the data analysis and start to organize your slides.  Week 10 will not have a regular class meeting given the shortened week, and instead the usual Wednesday class meeting will serve as extra Open Door Hours for you to get advice/help from the teaching staff.
