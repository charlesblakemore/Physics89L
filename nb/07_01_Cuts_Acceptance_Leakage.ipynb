    "\n",
    "1. To understand a real situation in which we are optimizing selection criteria to distinguish between \"signal\" and \"background\", in a search for elusive dark matter particles.\n",
    "2. To wonder what these dark matter particles are anyway.\n",
    "3. To understand the different between \"covariance\" and \"correlation\" and the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n",
    "4. To deepen out understanding with examples of quantities that are highly correlated and quantities that are uncorrelated.\n",

    "### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to finish this notebook in 30-35 minutes. \n",

    "# Hunting for dark matter in LUX-ZEPLIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Only about 15% of the matter in the universe is composed of particles (electrons, protons, etc.) that scientists have been able to study in great detail. The other 85% is composed of an unknown, \"dark\" matter that can interact gravitationally, but whose other kinds of interactions aren't well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways scientists can probe those other interactions of dark matter. Detectors like the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) detector shown below hope to \"directly detect\" dark matter by looking for rare scatters of dark matter particles on a target material. In LZ's case, a dark matter particle might interact with a atomic nucleus of one of the atoms within the detector (specifically, xenon). This produces flashes of light that can be detected, called \"S1\" and \"S2.\" The presence of one or both of these tells us that we have seen a particle interacting with the xenon, which we refer to as an **\"event\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/LZDetector.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just because we see an event, it doesn't mean we're necessarily seeing dark matter interact. For example, an S1+S2 may instead be created by a random interaction of an ambient $\\gamma$ ray (high energy photon) or electron ($\\beta$) hitting our xenon atoms. So to search for dark matter interactions, it is first important to understand the difference between those so-called \"background\" events, and so-called \"signal\" events:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** These are events from known physics, that may mimic dark matter. Examples: $\\gamma$-ray interactions, $\\beta$ interactions, etc. Think of these as \"boring\" events, which we don't care about seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal:** These are possible dark matter or other \"new physics\" events. These are \"interesting\" events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In LZ, signal and background events have different detection signatures that allow us to distinguish whether an event is due to signal or background. For example, S2s of background events are slightly more bright than S2s of signal events, because $\\gamma$s and $\\beta$s tend to interact with the atomic charge cloud instead of the xenon nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many different physics processes underlying the interactions that create the S1 and S2, and it's not possible to *perfectly* distinguish whether an individual event is signal or background. In other words, there's some fraction of background events that look more like signal events, and some fraction of signal events that look more like background events. This situation, where signal and backgrounds overlap to some degree, is extremely common in event-based experiments. In this lab, we will explore the analysis methods used to do searches for rare signals under such conditions."

Let's load in 100,000 events from a $\\beta$ calibration source, and look at the sizes of the S2 flashes. There's a good deal of spread in these S2 sizes, so we typically look at the logarithm of the S2 size instead of the size itself, i.e. Log10(S2)."
